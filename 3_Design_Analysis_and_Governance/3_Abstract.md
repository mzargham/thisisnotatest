# Module 3: Design, Analysis, and Governance - Abstract

## Overview
This module explores **design processes**, **decision-making frameworks**, and **adaptive governance** for managing **complex systems**. It focuses on tools for addressing **trade-offs**, **constraints**, and **uncertainty**, emphasizing the need to balance **formal rules** with **relational governance**. By synthesizing **theory**, **practice**, and **synthesis**, it highlights how systems can be **designed to adapt**, rather than **optimized to predict**.

## Key Themes
1. **Adaptive Design** – Examines **bounded rationality** (Simon) and **heuristics** (Hamming) to navigate **complexity and uncertainty**.  
2. **Cybernetics and Feedback** – Explores **feedback loops** and **self-regulation** (Beer, Swann) to balance **autonomy and control**.  
3. **Resilience and Risk** – Focuses on **trade-offs** (Leveson) and **constraint satisfaction** (Ashby) to manage **safety and adaptability**.  
4. **Relational and Ethical Design** – Emphasizes **reciprocity**, **distributed agency**, and **heterogeneous systems** (Latour, LaDuke).  

## Unifying Questions
1. How can governance systems balance **autonomy and control** without sacrificing **resilience**?  
2. What role do **feedback loops** and **heuristics** play in managing **uncertainty and constraints**?  
3. How do **technical frameworks** (Beer, Leveson) interact with **ethical and relational systems** (Latour, LaDuke)?
