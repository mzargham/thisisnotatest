## Key Concepts
- **Relational Governance** - Emphasizes **reciprocity**, **responsibility**, and **sustainability** as foundations for governance.  
- **Ecological Resilience** - Practices adaptive governance through **seasonal cycles**, **monitoring**, and **feedback**—echoing **Holling’s adaptive cycles**.  
- **Sovereignty and Self-Determination** - Advocates **local governance** rooted in **cultural ethics**, challenging **centralized control**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **indigenous frameworks** of governance reinforce **resilience** and **reciprocity**?  
2. Can ecological governance balance **local autonomy** with **larger coordination systems** (Beer, Ostrom)?  
3. What lessons do **indigenous approaches** offer for **modern governance challenges** (climate change, resource management)?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare LaDuke’s **relational models** to **Latour’s actor-network theory**—how do they both emphasize **heterogenous systems**?  
- Debate whether **cultural protocols** act as a form of **feedback loops**, aligning with **Beer’s cybernetics** and **Swann’s anarchist frameworks**.  
- Reflect on how **adaptive cycles** (Holling) and **polycentric governance** (Ostrom) resonate with **LaDuke’s ecological models**.
