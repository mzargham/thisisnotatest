## Key Concepts
- **Bureaucracy and Control** - Bureaucratic systems impose **rules and constraints**, but also create **spaces for innovation**.  
- **Flexibility vs. Rigidity** - Tensions between **formal rules** and **adaptive practices** mirror debates about **rules-in-use** vs. **rules-in-form** (Ostrom).  
- **Power and Creativity** - Bureaucracies reinforce **power hierarchies**, but also allow **loopholes and improvisation**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does **bureaucratic structure** both enable and constrain **adaptive governance**?  
2. Can **formal rules** coexist with **informal norms** to promote **resilience**?  
3. What parallels exist between **bureaucracy in governance systems** and **platform governance models** (Eghbal)?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Graeber’s critiques of **bureaucracy** with **Lessig’s architectural regulation**—are systems **inherently rigid** or **adaptive**?  
- Debate whether **bureaucratic systems** can sustain **feedback and learning**, as proposed by **Beer’s cybernetics**.  
- Reflect on how **Graeber’s views** complement **Eghbal’s open-source platforms**—can platforms function without **bureaucratic frameworks**?
