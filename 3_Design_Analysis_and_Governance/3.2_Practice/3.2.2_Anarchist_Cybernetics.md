## Key Concepts
- **Decentralized Control** - Systems achieve **autonomy** through **feedback loops** and **distributed decision-making**.  
- **Feedback and Adaptation** - Reinforces **Beer’s cybernetics** by focusing on **self-regulation** and **local adjustments**.  
- **Organizational Resilience** - Explores how **anarchist principles** sustain **resilience** in **self-organizing systems**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **feedback loops** support **self-governance** in decentralized systems?  
2. Can **cybernetics** balance **autonomy** with **coordination** in larger systems?  
3. What parallels exist between **anarchist organizing** and **open-source platforms** (Eghbal)?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare **Swann’s anarchist models** with **Beer’s viable systems**—how do they manage **feedback and control**?  
- Debate whether **polycentric governance** (Ostrom) aligns with **anarchist principles** or requires **hierarchy**.  
- Reflect on the role of **process thinking** (Hamming) in anarchist systems—does learning-by-doing reinforce **resilience**?
