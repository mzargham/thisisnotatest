| **Adaptive Design**        | The process of creating systems that evolve and adjust over time in response to changing conditions. | Simon – The Sciences of the Artificial (1969) |
| **Bounded Rationality**    | Decision-making limited by **cognitive constraints**, **time**, and **available information**.      | Simon – The Sciences of the Artificial (1969) |
| **Heuristics**             | Rules-of-thumb or **simplified strategies** for problem-solving under **uncertainty**.              | Hamming – The Art of Doing Science and Engineering (1997) |
| **Cybernetics**            | The study of **feedback, control, and communication** in systems, emphasizing **self-regulation**.   | Beer – Designing Freedom (1974) |
| **Feedback Loop**          | Processes where **system outputs influence inputs**, leading to **reinforcing** or **balancing** effects. | Beer – Designing Freedom (1974) |
| **Resilience**             | The capacity of a system to **absorb disturbances** and **adapt** without losing core functionality.  | Leveson – Engineering a Safer World (2012) |
| **Risk Management**        | Processes for **identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks** to ensure **system safety**.          | Leveson – Engineering a Safer World (2012) |
| **Actor-Network Theory**   | A framework for understanding systems as **networks of humans, technologies, and environments**.     | Latour – We Have Never Been Modern (1991) |
| **Distributed Agency**     | Decision-making and influence spread across **multiple actors** rather than centralized authority.  | Latour – We Have Never Been Modern (1991) |
| **Constraint Satisfaction**| The process of meeting **multiple, overlapping constraints** simultaneously, focusing on **trade-offs**. | Ashby – An Introduction to Cybernetics (1956) |
| **Requisite Variety**      | The principle that systems must have **internal complexity** equal to the complexity they face to remain **viable**. | Ashby – An Introduction to Cybernetics (1956) |
| **Satisficing**            | Choosing **good-enough solutions** rather than **optimizing** under constraints.                      | Simon – The Sciences of the Artificial (1969) |
| **Process Thinking**       | A focus on **iteration**, **learning-by-doing**, and **feedback mechanisms** in decision-making.      | Hamming – The Art of Doing Science and Engineering (1997) |
| **Relational Governance**  | Governance systems that emphasize **reciprocity**, **ethics**, and **distributed relationships**.     | LaDuke – All Our Relations (1999) |
| **Heterogeneous Systems**  | Systems composed of **humans, technologies, and environments**, interacting through **networks**.     | Latour – We Have Never Been Modern (1991) |
