# Module 3: Discussion Questions - Design, Analysis, and Governance

## Critical Thinking and Debate

### **Design and Decision-Making**
1. **Bounded Rationality vs. Optimization**:  
   - How do **bounded rationality** (Simon) and **heuristics** (Hamming) change how we approach **decision-making under uncertainty**?  
   - Can systems designed for **constraint satisfaction** be more effective than those built for **optimization**?  

2. **Learning and Feedback**:  
   - Compare **Beer’s cybernetics** with **Swann’s anarchist frameworks**—how do **feedback loops** enable **self-regulation** and **adaptation**?  
   - What limits exist in applying **cybernetic principles** to **social governance systems**?  

### **Risk, Safety, and Adaptability**
3. **Risk and Trade-Offs**:  
   - How do **Leveson’s risk management frameworks** address **conflicting constraints** in complex systems?  
   - Can safety ever be **designed in advance**, or does it always require **ongoing monitoring and adaptation**?  

4. **Resilience vs. Stability**:  
   - Reflect on how **constraint satisfaction** (Ashby) and **feedback systems** (Beer) handle **resilience**—do they prioritize **stability** or **adaptability**?  
   - How do systems evolve when they fail to match their **internal complexity** to external **challenges**?  

### **Relational and Ethical Design**
5. **Relational Governance**:  
   - Compare **Latour’s actor-network theory** and **LaDuke’s ecological frameworks**—how do they redefine **governance** to emphasize **reciprocity** and **relationships**?  
   - How do ethical frameworks like **LaDuke’s reciprocity** complement **technical systems** like **Beer’s viable systems**?  

6. **Distributed Agency**:  
   - Can governance systems designed around **distributed agency** balance **autonomy** and **control**?  
   - Reflect on modern platforms (Eghbal)—how does **decentralization** reinforce or challenge **adaptive governance**?  

## Essay Prompts

1. **Constraint Satisfaction and Complexity**:  
   Analyze how systems handle **conflicting constraints**—compare frameworks like **Ashby’s requisite variety** and **Leveson’s risk models**. What trade-offs are unavoidable?  

2. **Resilience and Feedback Loops**:  
   Explore the role of **feedback mechanisms** in maintaining **resilience** (Beer, Swann). How do **heuristics** and **process thinking** (Hamming) improve adaptability?  

3. **Relational vs. Technical Design**:  
   Discuss the tension between **formal governance frameworks** (Leveson, Beer) and **relational governance models** (Latour, LaDuke). When should governance focus on **rules**, and when on **relationships**?  

4. **Timescales and Adaptation**:  
   Reflect on **Brand’s pace layering** and **Ashby’s control systems**—how do systems balance **short-term responses** with **long-term resilience**?
