## Key Concepts
- **Cybernetics and Feedback Loops** - Governance systems depend on **monitoring**, **adjusting**, and **learning** to remain **viable**.  
- **Viable Systems Models (VSM)** - Balances **autonomy and control**, reinforcing **adaptive governance** principles.  
- **Satisfying Constraints** - Designs prioritize **flexibility** over **optimization**, focusing on **constraint satisfaction** and **processes**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **feedback loops** enable systems to balance **stability** and **adaptation**?  
2. What role do **autonomy** and **distributed control** play in maintaining **resilience**?  
3. How does Beer’s focus on **viable systems** address **trade-offs** between **efficiency and adaptability**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Beer’s **cybernetics** with **Swann’s anarchist models**—how do they handle **conflict and coordination**?  
- Debate whether **constraint satisfaction** should prioritize **short-term goals** (finite systems) or **long-term resilience** (infinite systems).  
- Reflect on how **Beer’s feedback loops** complement **Leveson’s safety models**—what frameworks support **adaptive governance**?
