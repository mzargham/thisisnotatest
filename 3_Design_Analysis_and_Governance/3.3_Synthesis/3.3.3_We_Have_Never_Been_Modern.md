## Key Concepts
- **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)** - Governance systems are **heterogeneous networks** of **humans, technologies, and environments**.  
- **Relational Systems** - Governance depends on managing **distributed agency** and addressing **conflicting priorities**.  
- **Critique of Modernity** - Challenges **simplified categories**, emphasizing **hybrid systems** and **feedback processes**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does Latour’s **actor-network theory** challenge **technocratic governance models**?  
2. What role do **heterogeneous systems** play in balancing **local knowledge** and **formal design frameworks**?  
3. Can **distributed agency** manage **conflicting goals** within **adaptive governance systems**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Latour’s **heterogeneous systems** with **Beer’s cybernetics**—how do they handle **complex constraints**?  
- Debate whether **governance models** should prioritize **relations over rules**, tying to **LaDuke’s reciprocity frameworks**.  
- Reflect on how **Latour’s networks** reinforce **constraint satisfaction** across **social and ecological domains**—what lessons apply to **modern governance platforms**?
