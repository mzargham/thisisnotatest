# 3.3.2 Engineering a Safer World

## Short Excerpt
> *"Safety is not the absence of risk; it is the ability to manage uncertainty and trade-offs through design."*

## Key Concepts
- **Safety and Risk Management** - Systems must **identify hazards**, **prioritize trade-offs**, and **balance constraints** to maintain **stability**.  
- **Adaptive Safety Frameworks** - Focuses on **monitoring processes** and **feedback mechanisms** to handle **uncertainty**.  
- **Limits of Quantification** - Highlights where **formal modeling** must yield to **heuristics and judgment**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **formal safety models** manage **uncertainty and trade-offs**?  
2. What role do **feedback loops** play in balancing **safety, reliability, and adaptability**?  
3. Can systems be **safe-by-design**, or must they always rely on **ongoing monitoring and adjustment**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Leveson’s **safety frameworks** with **Beer’s cybernetics**—how do they handle **feedback** and **conflict resolution**?  
- Debate whether **resilience** depends more on **prediction models** or **adaptive processes**—what trade-offs emerge?  
- Reflect on how **Leveson’s focus on safety** aligns with **LaDuke’s relational governance**—how do cultural values shape risk management?
