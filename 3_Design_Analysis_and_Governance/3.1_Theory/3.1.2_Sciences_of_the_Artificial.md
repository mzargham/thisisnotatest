## Key Concepts
- **Bounded Rationality** - Decision-making operates within **constraints**, emphasizing **satisficing** over **optimization**.  
- **Heuristics and Modularity** - Complex systems should be **decomposable** into parts, allowing **local adaptation** and **learning**.  
- **Design as Problem Solving** - Governance frameworks balance **structure and adaptability**, managing **uncertainty** through **feedback loops**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **bounded rationality** and **heuristics** shape governance systems under **uncertainty**?  
2. What role does **modularity** play in **adaptive design**, and how does it reinforce **resilience**?  
3. Can systems be **intentionally designed** to evolve, or must they rely on **emergence**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Simon’s design principles with **Beer’s cybernetics**—how do **modularity** and **feedback** interact?  
- Debate whether Simon’s **satisficing principles** support or contradict **Scott’s critique** of **simplified systems**.  
- Reflect on how Simon’s emphasis on **modular design** complements **Jacobs’ emergent urban complexity**.
