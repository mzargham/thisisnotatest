## Key Concepts
- **Learning and Judgment** - Systems rely on **iteration**, **heuristics**, and **critical thinking** to handle **complexity**.  
- **Heuristics and Feedback** - Balances **formal structures** with **trial-and-error learning**, prioritizing **adaptability**.  
- **Process Thinking** - Emphasizes designing systems with **processes** that can evolve through **feedback and experimentation**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does **learning-by-doing** reinforce **resilience** and **decision-making**?  
2. What role do **heuristics** play in managing **uncertainty** in governance systems?  
3. How can **model-building** improve **judgment** without promoting **overconfidence**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Hamming’s focus on **process thinking** to **Scott’s critique of simplification**—how do they approach **complexity**?  
- Debate whether **engineering principles** can scale beyond **physical systems** to **social and governance models**.  
- Reflect on the role of **failure** as a feedback mechanism—how does it reinforce **resilience** (Petroski, Leveson)?
