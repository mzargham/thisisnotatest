# 3.1.1 Finite and Infinite Games

## Short Excerpt
> *"There are at least two kinds of games: finite and infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play."*  
> — James P. Carse, *Finite and Infinite Games* (1986).

## Key Concepts
- **Finite Games** - Systems with **fixed rules, goals, and winners**, emphasizing **competition and closure**.  
- **Infinite Games** - Systems focused on **continuity, adaptability, and evolution**, prioritizing **ongoing engagement** over **fixed outcomes**.  
- **Rules and Constraints** - Examines how rules can be **boundaries or invitations** for **adaptation and creativity**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **finite and infinite games** mirror **designed systems** vs. **emergent systems**?  
2. What types of governance systems reflect **finite goals** (control) versus **infinite goals** (adaptation)?  
3. Can systems be **reconfigured** to shift from **finite to infinite games**, and what trade-offs emerge?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Carse’s **finite and infinite frameworks** with **Simon’s satisficing approach**—how do they approach **uncertainty** and **design limits**?  
- Debate whether **governance frameworks** (e.g., Ostrom’s commons or Beer’s cybernetics) should be designed as **finite or infinite systems**.  
- Reflect on **digital governance** (Eghbal) and **platforms**—are they finite games or evolving systems?
