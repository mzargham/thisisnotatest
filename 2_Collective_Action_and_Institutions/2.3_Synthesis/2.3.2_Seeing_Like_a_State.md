## Key Concepts
- **High-Modernism and Simplification** - Centralized systems attempt to **simplify complexity**, often ignoring **local knowledge** and producing **fragile outcomes**.  
- **Legibility and Control** - States impose **legibility** (e.g., maps, censuses) to make systems easier to manage, but this often **destabilizes ecosystems and societies**.  
- **Metis (Local Knowledge)** - Argues for **practical, experience-based knowledge** as more **adaptive and resilient** than **abstract planning**.  
- **Resilience and Collapse** - Illustrates how **rigid systems collapse** when they fail to adapt to **feedback loops** and **emergent behaviors**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does **simplification** impact the **resilience** of complex systems?  
2. What are the trade-offs between **legibility and adaptability** in governance models?  
3. How does **local knowledge** reinforce **resilience**, and when might it be insufficient?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare **Scott’s critique of centralized planning** to **Ostrom’s adaptive governance**—where do they align, and where do they diverge?  
- Debate whether modern **technological governance** (e.g., Lessig’s code) risks reproducing **high-modernist failures**.  
- Analyze examples of **urban planning failures** and **successes** through Scott’s lens—what lessons apply to **digital and ecological systems**?
