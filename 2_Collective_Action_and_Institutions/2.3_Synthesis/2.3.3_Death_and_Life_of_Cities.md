## Key Concepts
- **Diversity and Complexity** - Healthy systems emerge through **local interactions** and **layered diversity**, reinforcing **resilience**.  
- **Emergent Order** - Urban systems stabilize through **self-organization** and **adaptive growth**, not **central planning**.  
- **Failure of Top-Down Design** - Critiques **modernist planning** for ignoring **local dynamics** and creating **rigid, unstable environments**.  
- **Trust and Accountability** - Informal networks sustain **accountability** and **cooperation**, echoing **Ostrom’s commons governance**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **local knowledge and informal networks** contribute to **resilience** in urban systems?  
2. In what ways does **Jacobs’ critique of urban planning** parallel **Scott’s critique of high-modernism**?  
3. Can Jacobs’ ideas about **incremental growth and diversity** apply to **digital governance** and **platform design**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare **Jacobs’ focus on emergent order** to **Ostrom’s principles of polycentric governance**—what are their shared assumptions?  
- Debate whether **cities function as commons** and, if so, how governance principles apply across **physical and digital spaces**.  
- Reflect on modern examples of **adaptive urban planning** and how they reinforce **Jacobs’ principles**—what lessons apply to **platform governance**?
