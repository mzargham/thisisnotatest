| **Adaptive Governance** | Systems that balance flexibility and control through feedback and iteration. | Ostrom – Selected Works |

| **Feedback Loops** | Circular processes that reinforce (positive) or counteract (negative) changes in systems. | Axelrod – Evolution of Cooperation |
| **High-Modernism** | Centralized planning that simplifies systems but often ignores complexity and local knowledge. | Scott – Seeing Like a State |
| **Legibility** | The process of making systems simplifiable and controllable, often at the cost of resilience. | Scott – Seeing Like a State |
| **Metis (Local Knowledge)** | Practical, experience-based knowledge that supports adaptive governance and resilience. | Scott – Seeing Like a State |
| **Polycentric Governance** | Systems with multiple centers of decision-making that balance local autonomy and coordination. | Ostrom – Selected Works |
| **Sustainability Framework** | Frameworks for managing ecological and social resilience through feedback and adaptation. | Berkes – Sacred Ecology |
| **Urban Complexity** | The emergent order of cities and neighborhoods, sustained through diverse interactions. | Jacobs – Death and Life of Cities |
| **Cooperation Strategies** | Behavioral rules, such as reciprocity, that foster trust and collaboration in repeated interactions. | Axelrod – Evolution of Cooperation |
| **Norm Evolution** | The emergence and reinforcement of social norms through iteration and feedback. | Ostrom – Selected Works |
| **Institutional Diversity** | The existence of multiple forms of governance adapted to specific contexts, promoting resilience. | Ostrom – Selected Works |
| **Accountability** | Mechanisms to ensure transparency and responsibility in distributed systems. | Suchman – Selected Works |
| **Platform Governance** | The management of digital platforms through infrastructure, norms, and reputation systems. | Eghbal – Working in Public |
| **Digital Commons** | Resources shared and governed collectively in online platforms, mirroring physical commons governance. | Eghbal – Working in Public |
| **Formal Institutions** | Explicit rules, laws, and regulations that structure governance. | North – Institutions |
| **Informal Institutions** | Norms, traditions, and conventions that influence behavior outside formal structures. | North – Institutions |
| **Path Dependence** | The influence of historical decisions on current systems, often locking in structures over time. | North – Institutions |
| **Emergent Order** | Self-organizing systems that evolve complexity without centralized control. | Jacobs – Death and Life of Cities |
| **Resilience** | The ability of systems to absorb shocks and adapt without losing core functionality. | Berkes – Sacred Ecology |
| **Adaptation** | The process by which systems adjust to changing conditions to maintain stability. | Ostrom – Selected Works |
| **Legitimacy** | The perception that rules or governance systems are fair, justifying compliance and enforcement. | North – Institutions |
| **Trust Networks** | Informal connections that reinforce cooperation and accountability through social ties. | Jacobs – Death and Life of Cities |
| **Markets** | Economic mechanisms that regulate behavior through pricing, incentives, and competition. | Lessig – Code 2.0 |
| **Norms** | Social expectations and informal rules that influence behavior outside legal frameworks. | Lessig – Code 2.0 |
| **Architecture** | Design structures, including code and infrastructure, that shape behavior by embedding constraints and permissions. | Lessig – Code 2.0 |
| **Law** | Explicit legal rules enforced by authorities to regulate and constrain behavior. | Lessig – Code 2.0 |
| **Contribution Guides** | Documents that define rules, processes, and expectations for contributing to collaborative projects, reducing friction and improving governance. | Eghbal – Working in Public |
| **Rules** | Explicit constraints and guidelines that govern behavior within institutions. | North – Institutions |
| **Norms** | Informal, socially enforced expectations that influence behavior outside formal legal frameworks. | North – Institutions |
| **Rules-in-Use** | The actual rules that govern behavior in practice, often evolving through social interactions. | Ostrom – Selected Works |
| **Rules-in-Form** | The formally stated rules or regulations that structure governance systems, regardless of how they operate in practice. | Ostrom – Selected Works |
