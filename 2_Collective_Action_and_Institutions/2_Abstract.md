# Module 2: Collective Action and Institutions - Abstract

## Overview
This module explores **collective action and institutions**, emphasizing the **balance between rules and norms**, **formal and informal structures**, and **designed vs. emergent systems**. It examines how **rules-in-form** (stated regulations) differ from **rules-in-use** (actual practices), highlighting the interplay between **architecture, law, and social norms** in sustaining **resilience and accountability**.

Building on **Module 1’s systems thinking**, this section focuses on **social and institutional systems**, using examples from **digital governance**, **open-source collaboration**, **ecological systems**, and **urban networks**. The readings offer **contrasting views**—from **centralized planning** (Scott) to **distributed governance** (Ostrom) and **self-organizing urban complexity** (Jacobs).

## Core Themes
1. **Rules and Norms** - **Formal rules** (North) and **informal norms** (Ostrom, Lessig) structure behavior, with tensions between **rules-in-form** and **rules-in-use** influencing adaptation.  
2. **Cooperation and Feedback** - Adaptive systems evolve through **iteration** and **feedback loops**, reinforcing **trust and resilience** (Axelrod, Eghbal).  
3. **Distributed vs. Centralized Governance** - Case studies highlight **polycentric systems** (Ostrom) and **emergent urban order** (Jacobs) while critiquing **simplified top-down planning** (Scott).  
4. **Governance as Design** - Systems embed constraints through **architecture** (Lessig) and **platform rules** (Eghbal), balancing **control and flexibility**.  

## Unifying Questions
1. How do **rules and norms** interact to create **effective governance systems**?  
2. What are the trade-offs between **formal laws** (rules-in-form) and **practical norms** (rules-in-use)?  
3. How can **adaptive systems** incorporate **feedback mechanisms** to balance **stability and flexibility**?
