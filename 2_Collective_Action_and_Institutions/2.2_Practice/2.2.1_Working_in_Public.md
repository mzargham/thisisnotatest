## Key Concepts
- **Platform Governance** - Modern open source development depends on **platforms** (e.g., GitHub) that mediate collaboration and visibility.  
- **Maintainers as Gatekeepers** - Maintainers act as **de facto governors**, balancing public contributions and private responsibility.  
- **Labor and Sustainability** - Highlights the **burdens of maintenance** and the fragility of **volunteer-driven systems**.  
- **Distributed Governance** - Examines how **governance emerges organically** through social norms and infrastructure.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does the shift from **projects** to **platforms** change the dynamics of **governance and collaboration**?  
2. What challenges do **maintainers** face in balancing **openness** with **control**, and how do these challenges relate to **institutional design**?  
3. How do **sustainability and labor dynamics** in open source mirror challenges in **governing commons resources**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Eghbal’s findings with **Ostrom’s principles of commons governance**. Are open source platforms examples of **digital commons**?  
- Debate whether **platform-based governance** centralizes too much power or effectively **distributes control** through visibility and reputation systems.  
- Analyze examples of **failure** in open source governance (e.g., burnout, forks). How do these cases reflect broader **issues of resilience** and **sustainability**?  
- Discuss whether open source models could be applied to **governance outside software development** (e.g., urban planning, data sharing). What limitations might arise?
