## Key Concepts
- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)** - Long-standing practices rooted in **local knowledge**, reinforcing **resilience and sustainability**.  
- **Adaptive Management** - Governance systems that **monitor and adjust** policies based on **feedback loops** and **environmental variability**.  
- **Commons Governance** - Shared resource management through **distributed control**, **norms**, and **informal rules**, echoing **Ostrom’s principles**.  
- **Resilience Thinking** - Balances **stability and transformation**, emphasizing **renewal cycles** and **cross-scale dynamics**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does **local ecological knowledge** differ from **scientific approaches** to governance?  
2. What role do **feedback mechanisms** and **adaptive cycles** play in maintaining ecological resilience?  
3. How can lessons from **traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)** be applied to **modern governance systems**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare **Berkes’ TEK approach** to **Ostrom’s commons governance**. Are informal, local rules more **resilient** than formal systems?  
- Discuss how **adaptive management** aligns with **Holling’s cycles of collapse and renewal**. What patterns emerge?  
- Debate whether **traditional systems** offer scalable solutions for **global environmental governance** or whether they are **context-specific**.  
- Explore how Berkes’ insights might apply to **digital platforms** and **technological commons**—do we see parallels between **ecological and digital governance**?
