# 2.1 Theory Summary - Collective Action and Institutions

## Overview
This section examines **collective action and institutions**, focusing on how **rules, norms, and architectures** shape behavior and cooperation. It emphasizes the role of **formal and informal constraints**, **feedback mechanisms**, and **adaptive strategies** in maintaining order and enabling change.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Code as Law** – Lawrence Lessig highlights **technology as governance**, arguing that **architectural constraints** embedded in systems function like **laws**, shaping behavior and access.  
2. **Institutions** – Douglas North defines **institutions** as the **rules of the game**, explaining how they create **path dependence**, reduce **transaction costs**, and evolve through **incentives**.  
3. **Cooperation** – Robert Axelrod models **cooperation among self-interested agents**, showing how **repeated interactions** and **strategies** like **Tit-for-Tat** reinforce **trust and stability**.

## Comprehension Questions
1. How do **formal rules** (laws) differ from **informal norms**, and how do they complement each other in governance?  
2. What role do **architectures and design choices** play in regulating behavior (e.g., Lessig’s code vs. North’s institutions)?  
3. How do **feedback loops** influence the emergence of **cooperation** in Axelrod’s computational models?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare **Lessig’s argument** about code as law with **North’s institutions**—how do their approaches to governance reflect **explicit design** vs. **emergent order**?  
- Debate whether **platform governance** (Eghbal) mirrors the **commons governance** described by **Ostrom** and **Berkes**—are digital systems a new kind of commons?  
- How do **adaptive cycles** (Holling) and **feedback mechanisms** (Meadows) support or challenge Axelrod’s **models of cooperation**?
