## Key Concepts
- **Tit-for-Tat Strategy** - A cooperative strategy that reciprocates cooperation or defection, showing **adaptive behavior**.  
- **Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma** - A framework for modeling **trust and cooperation** over repeated interactions.  
- **Emergent Cooperation** - Cooperation arises **without central authority** through **self-reinforcing strategies**.  
- **Evolutionary Dynamics** - Successful strategies are **replicated**, leading to **behavioral adaptation** over time.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does the **Tit-for-Tat strategy** encourage cooperation even among **self-interested agents**?  
2. What conditions are necessary for **cooperation to emerge** in competitive environments?  
3. How do **feedback loops** and **iteration** reinforce cooperative behavior?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Axelrod’s computational models with **Forrester’s system dynamics** and **Holling’s adaptive cycles**. How do their approaches to **feedback and behavior** align?  
- Debate whether **cooperation is innate or constructed**. Does Axelrod’s work imply that **trust can be engineered**?  
- Reflect on modern applications—how do **digital platforms** (e.g., reputation systems) encourage cooperation in **online communities**?
