## Key Concepts
- **Institutions as Rules** - Institutions include **formal rules** (laws, regulations) and **informal constraints** (norms, traditions) that shape behavior.  
- **Path Dependence** - Historical processes influence institutional development, creating **lock-in effects**.  
- **Transaction Costs** - Institutions reduce **uncertainty** by creating stable structures for interaction, lowering costs of negotiation and enforcement.  
- **Institutional Change** - Institutions evolve as actors respond to **incentives**, often through gradual adjustments rather than abrupt reforms.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. What distinguishes **formal rules** from **informal constraints**, and how do they reinforce each other?  
2. How does **path dependence** influence the **persistence or change** of institutions over time?  
3. Can institutions be **designed**, or do they always **emerge organically**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare North’s definition of **institutions** with Lessig’s view of **code as law**. How do they approach **governance by design**?  
- Discuss examples of **institutional lock-in** (e.g., QWERTY keyboards, legal frameworks). When should we **preserve stability** versus **promote change**?  
- How do North’s insights apply to **modern governance systems**, particularly in **digital spaces** regulated by Lessig’s code?
