# Module 1: Models and Their Limits - Abstract

## Overview
This module introduces the **foundations of systems thinking**, focusing on **variation in time and space**, **feedback loops**, and **control mechanisms**. It highlights how **structure influences behavior** and how **models simplify complexity** to make systems **understandable and adaptable**. Readers will explore concepts like **requisite variety**, **pace layering**, and **design patterns** to understand **stability and change** in complex systems.  

## Key Themes
1. **System Dynamics** - Explores **feedback loops**, **stocks and flows**, and **behavioral patterns** that define systems.  
2. **Temporal and Spatial Variation** - Emphasizes **diversity across timescales** (Brand) and **spatial patterns** (Alexander) to enhance **resilience**.  
3. **Requisite Variety and Control** - Introduces Ashbyâ€™s **Law of Requisite Variety**, showing how **internal complexity** must match **external demands** to maintain **stability and adaptability**.  

## Unifying Questions
1. How do **system structures** influence **behavioral patterns** over time?  
2. What role does **requisite variety** play in enabling systems to adapt and survive?  
3. How do **feedback loops** and **patterns** reinforce **resilience** across **temporal and spatial scales**?
