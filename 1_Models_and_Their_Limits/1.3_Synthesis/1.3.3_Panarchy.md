## Key Concepts
- **Adaptive Cycles** - Systems move through **growth, conservation, collapse, and renewal**.  
- **Cross-Scale Dynamics** - **Fast and slow processes** interact to shape stability and transformation.  
- **Resilience Theory** - Emphasizes **flexibility and renewal** over rigid stability.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does **collapse** contribute to **resilience** in systems?  
2. What role do **slow processes** (e.g., conservation) and **fast processes** (e.g., innovation) play in system evolution?  
3. How can understanding **adaptive cycles** inform approaches to governance and sustainability?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Holling’s **adaptive cycles** with **Forrester’s urban dynamics** and **Brand’s pace layering**. What patterns emerge?  
- Discuss examples of **collapse and renewal** in real systems (e.g., economic crises, ecosystems). How does Holling’s framework explain these dynamics?  
- How does Holling’s emphasis on **flexibility** contrast with Gordon’s focus on **physical stability**?
