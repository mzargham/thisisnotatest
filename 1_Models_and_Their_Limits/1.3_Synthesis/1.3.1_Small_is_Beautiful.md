## Key Concepts
- **Human-Scale Design** - Systems should be **locally adaptable** rather than monolithic.  
- **Limits of Prediction** - Critiques **technocratic solutions**, emphasizing **judgment over formulas**.  
- **Interconnectedness** - Advocates **holistic systems** built on **context-specific solutions**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. What are the risks of relying solely on **scale and efficiency** in system design?  
2. How can **local adaptability** improve resilience in modern systems?  
3. In what ways does Schumacher’s critique of **technocracy** relate to contemporary issues in technology and governance?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Schumacher’s emphasis on **local adaptability** with **Mollison’s permaculture principles**. How do they address resilience?  
- How do Schumacher’s ideas about **appropriate scale** complement **Forrester’s systems modeling** and **Meadows’ leverage points**?  
- Discuss examples of **systems that failed due to monolithic design** and how Schumacher’s principles could have improved outcomes.
