## Key Concepts
- **Stress and Strain** - Physical forces that shape **resilience** and **failure** in structures.  
- **Learning from Failure** - Iteration as a tool for improving designs.  
- **Structural Resilience** - Simplicity and **efficiency in form** over complexity.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **structural failures** inform better design practices?  
2. What parallels exist between **physical resilience** and **adaptive resilience** in social or ecological systems?  
3. How do **forces and constraints** influence behavior in engineered systems?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Gordon’s approach to **resilience** with **Forrester’s feedback loops** and **Holling’s adaptive cycles**.  
- Discuss whether **simplicity in structure** parallels Schumacher’s argument for **local adaptability**.  
- How do principles of **failure and adaptation** apply beyond physical systems to **organizational and ecological systems**?
