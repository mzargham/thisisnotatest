|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adaptive Cycle** | A model describing the phases of growth, conservation, collapse, and reorganization in dynamic systems. | Holling – Panarchy (2002) |
| **Balancing Loop** | A feedback loop that counteracts change, promoting stability and equilibrium. | Meadows – Thinking in Systems (2008) |
| **Carrying Capacity** | The maximum population size or system load that an environment can sustain indefinitely. | Forrester – World Dynamics (1971) |
| **Collapse and Renewal** | The process by which systems fail and then reorganize to adapt to new conditions. | Holling – Panarchy (2002) |
| **Diversity** | The presence of multiple elements or subsystems that enhance resilience through redundancy and adaptability. | Mollison & Slay – Introduction to Permaculture (1991) |
| **Edge Effect** | The increased productivity and diversity that occur at the boundaries between ecosystems. | Mollison & Slay – Introduction to Permaculture (1991) |
| **Equilibrium** | A state of balance where system variables remain stable unless disturbed. | Forrester – Urban Dynamics (1969) |
| **Feedback Loop** | A circular process where outputs of a system influence its inputs, either reinforcing or balancing behavior. | Meadows – Thinking in Systems (2008) |
| **Leverage Points** | Places in a system where small interventions can lead to significant changes in behavior. | Meadows – Leverage Points (1999) |
| **Local Adaptability** | The ability of systems to be designed and maintained in ways that suit specific contexts and needs. | Schumacher – Small is Beautiful (1973) |
| **Model** | A simplified representation of a system used to understand and predict its behavior. | Meadows – Thinking in Systems (2008) |
| **Pace Layering** | A framework describing how systems evolve through fast-changing and slow-changing layers. | Brand – The Clock of the Long Now (1999) |
| **Permaculture** | A design philosophy that uses patterns and principles from nature to create resilient systems. | Mollison & Slay – Introduction to Permaculture (1991) |
| **Reinforcing Loop** | A feedback loop that amplifies changes, leading to exponential growth or collapse. | Meadows – Thinking in Systems (2008) |
| **Resilience** | The ability of a system to absorb disturbances and adapt without losing its core function. | Holling – Panarchy (2002) |
| **Scale** | The spatial, temporal, or organizational level at which a system operates and interacts. | Brand – The Clock of the Long Now (1999) |
| **Stress and Strain** | Forces acting on structures that determine their strength, resilience, and potential points of failure. | Gordon – Structures (1978) |
| **Structure** | The physical and organizational framework of a system that determines its behavior and constraints. | Gordon – Structures (1978) |
| **System Dynamics** | An approach for modeling and understanding complex systems through feedback and time delays. | Forrester – Urban Dynamics (1969) |
| **Threshold** | A critical point in a system where small changes can trigger large, irreversible transformations. | Holling – Panarchy (2002) |
| **Boundary Condition** | Constraints or assumptions defined at the edges of a model or system that shape its behavior. | Meadows – Thinking in Systems (2008) |
| **Phase Transition** | A shift in a system’s state caused by reaching a critical threshold, leading to new patterns of organization. | Holling – Panarchy (2002) |
| **Stable** | A system state that resists change and returns to equilibrium after disturbances. | Forrester – Urban Dynamics (1969) |
| **Unstable** | A system state that amplifies small disturbances, leading to significant changes or collapse. | Holling – Panarchy (2002) |
| **Robustness** | The ability of a system to maintain function and stability under external stresses without significant adaptation. | Gordon – Structures (1978) |
