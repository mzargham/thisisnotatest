| **Feedback Loop**   | A circular process where outputs of a system influence its inputs, either reinforcing or balancing behavior. | Meadows – *Thinking in Systems* (2008)                   |
| **Adaptive Cycle**  | A model describing the phases of growth, conservation, collapse, and reorganization in dynamic systems. | Holling – *Panarchy* (2002)                              |
| **Resilience**      | The ability of a system to absorb disturbances and adapt without losing its core function.         | Holling – *Panarchy* (2002)                              |
| **Pace Layering**   | A framework describing how systems evolve through fast-changing and slow-changing layers.          | Brand – *The Clock of the Long Now* (1999)               |
| **Permaculture**    | A design philosophy that uses patterns and principles from nature to create resilient systems.      | Mollison & Slay – *Introduction to Permaculture* (1991)  |
| **Stress and Strain** | Forces acting on structures that determine their strength, resilience, and potential points of failure. | Gordon – *Structures* (1978) |
| **Local Adaptability** | The ability of systems to be designed and maintained in ways that suit specific contexts and needs. | Schumacher – *Small is Beautiful* (1973)                 |
| **System Dynamics** | An approach for modeling and understanding complex systems through feedback and time delays.        | Forrester – *Urban Dynamics* (1969)                      |
