## Key Concepts
- **Patterns and Modularity** - Design systems using **reusable patterns** that emphasize **spatial relationships** and **modularity**.  
- **Adaptation and Fit** - Patterns balance **local needs** with **universal design principles**.  
- **Generative Design** - Systems emerge through **layered patterns**, reinforcing **resilience and adaptability**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **patterns** balance **local adaptation** and **universal structure**?  
2. What role does **modularity** play in **scaling design principles**?  
3. Can **patterns** be applied beyond architecture to **governance frameworks**?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Debate whether **modular design** is more effective than **centralized planning**—how does it reflect **polycentric governance**?  
- Reflect on **resilient design**—how do **patterns support adaptation**?
