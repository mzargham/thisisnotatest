## Key Concepts
- **Requisite Variety** - Systems must match **complexity** in their environment to maintain **stability and adaptability**.  
- **Feedback and Control** - **Monitoring and feedback loops** ensure **resilience** against **external disturbances**.  
- **Constraint Satisfaction** - Highlights the role of **constraints** and **flexibility** in **complex adaptive systems**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How does the **Law of Requisite Variety** apply to **adaptive systems** in governance and design?  
2. What role do **feedback loops** play in balancing **complexity and control**?  
3. Can systems be **too simple** or **too complex** to remain viable?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Debate whether systems designed for **constraint satisfaction** (Ashby) align with the principles of **satisficing** (Simon).  
- Reflect on the balance between **variety and simplicity**—how does this principle inform governance models?
