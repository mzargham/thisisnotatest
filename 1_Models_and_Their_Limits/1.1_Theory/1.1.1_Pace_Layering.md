## Key Concepts
- **Pace Layers** - Systems operate at **multiple timescales**, with **fast layers driving innovation** and **slow layers ensuring stability**.  
- **Resilience Through Layers** - Balances **change** and **continuity** across **temporal scales**.  
- **Learning and Memory** - Fast layers **learn** and adapt, while slow layers **store knowledge** and **maintain structure**.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do **pace layers** handle **conflict and adaptation** within systems?  
2. What trade-offs emerge between **fast innovation** and **slow stability**?  
3. How does **timescale diversity** reinforce **resilience** in governance?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Debate whether **slow layers** create **bottlenecks** or **buffers** in decision-making.  
- Reflect on governance systems—how can we **design for timescale diversity**?
