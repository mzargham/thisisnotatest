# Section 1: Discussion Questions - Models and Their Limits

## Critical Thinking and Debate

1. **Modeling and Prediction**: Debate whether **models are inherently dangerous** because they simplify reality, or if the **real danger lies in how they are used**.  

2. **Feedback Loops and Resilience**: Compare and contrast **adaptive cycles** from Holling with **feedback loops** in Forrester and Meadows. Which framework offers **better guidance** for managing complex systems?  

3. **Scales and Layering**: Are slower processes inherently **more stable** than faster ones, or can **speed be an asset** in certain contexts?  

## Essay Prompts

1. **Designing for Resilience**: Write an essay comparing **urban resilience** (Forrester) and **ecological resilience** (Holling).  
2. **The Ethics of Prediction and Control**: Examine the ethical implications of **using models to control human and natural systems**.
