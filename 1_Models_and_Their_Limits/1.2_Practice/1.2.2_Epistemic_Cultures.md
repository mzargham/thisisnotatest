## Key Concepts
- **Epistemic Cultures** - Different disciplines produce knowledge through distinct practices, tools, and social arrangements.  
- **Temporal Dynamics** - Long-term theory-building in physics vs. short, iterative experiments in biology highlight layered timescales.  
- **Human-Machine Interaction** - Feedback between tools and users drives adaptation and stabilization in knowledge practices.  
- **Infrastructure and Instruments** - The pace of discovery is shaped by the physical and technical systems supporting research.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do instruments influence the speed of discovery in physics versus biology?  
2. In what ways do slow and fast processes reinforce each other in scientific research?  
3. What parallels can you draw between these scientific cultures and systems you interact with in daily life?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare the long-term planning processes in high-energy physics to the short-term adaptability seen in biology. How do these differences affect resilience and stability?  
- Discuss the role of tools and instruments as mediators between fast and slow layers in knowledge systems.  
- Explore whether epistemic cultures in science mirror other systems (e.g., governance, technology, or ecology). How can we apply insights from this ethnography to non-scientific contexts?
