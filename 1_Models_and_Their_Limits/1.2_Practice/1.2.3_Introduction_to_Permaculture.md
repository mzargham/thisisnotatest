## Key Concepts
- **Patterns in Nature** - Observing and applying natural patterns to design productive, resilient systems.  
- **Zones and Sectors** - Organizing space based on **frequency of use** and **environmental factors** (e.g., sun, wind).  
- **Edge Effects** - Emphasizing transitions and boundaries as zones of high productivity and diversity.  
- **Water Systems and Earthworks** - Designing landscapes to manage **water flow** and **soil stability** through layered structures.  
- **Climatic Adaptation** - Spatial designs that respond to **environmental variations** to promote long-term sustainability.  

## Questions for Reflection
1. How do patterns in nature inform the spatial organization of permaculture systems?  
2. What role do **zones** and **sectors** play in maintaining diversity and resilience?  
3. How do edge effects reinforce productivity and stability in ecosystems?  
4. Can you identify examples of layered systems (physical or social) that mimic permaculture principles?  

## Discussion Prompts
- Compare Mollison’s spatial patterns to Alexander’s *A Pattern Language*. How do their approaches to diversity and stability overlap?  
- Analyze how permaculture’s zoning principles could be applied to **urban planning** or **infrastructure design**.  
- Discuss the role of **feedback loops** in maintaining permaculture systems, and relate these to **Urban Dynamics** (1.2.1).  
- How do spatial patterns in permaculture reflect Brand’s **pace layering**? Are there examples where fast and slow processes interact to create resilience?
