# This Is Not a Test

## Overview
**This Is Not a Test** explores how to build and rehabilitate **institutions** capable of sustaining **healthy relationships** with the **planet**, **biosphere**, and **each other**. It draws on **systems thinking**, **governance frameworks**, and **design processes** to confront **complexity**, **trade-offs**, and **constraint satisfaction** in **adaptive systems**.

### Course Structure
The course is divided into **three modules**, each exploring a **core idea** through **theory**, **practice**, and **synthesis**:

### **Keyword Coverage**
See [Keywords](keywords.md) for detailed definitions and examples of key concepts used throughout the readings.

### **Reading-Keyword Matrix**
See [Relationships](relationships.csv) for a detailed mapping of how each reading relates to key concepts.

The relationships between readings and keywords range from:
- **Direct** - Explicitly covers and develops the concept
- **Indirect** - Touches on or applies the concept without direct discussion
- **Not Covered** - Does not substantially engage with the concept

This mapping helps identify:
- Core texts for specific concepts
- Complementary readings that approach topics differently
