| **Systems Thinking**     | A framework for understanding **interconnected elements** and **feedback loops** within systems.   | Analyzing how traffic patterns adapt to road closures through feedback loops.                 |
| **Feedback Loops**       | Processes where outputs influence future inputs, either **reinforcing** or **balancing** changes.  | Population growth creating more births (reinforcing) or resource scarcity (balancing).       |
| **Requisite Variety**    | Systems must have **internal complexity** matching **external complexity** to remain viable.       | A thermostat adapting to temperature fluctuations to maintain room comfort.                  |
| **Constraint Satisfaction** | Balancing **overlapping constraints** to produce **workable solutions** rather than optimizing.   | Budgeting resources across departments to meet multiple conflicting needs.                    |
| **Resilience**           | The ability of a system to **absorb disturbances** and **adapt** without losing core functions.     | Coral reefs recovering from bleaching events by rebuilding ecosystems.                        |
| **Pace Layering**        | Layers of systems operating at **different timescales**, balancing **innovation** and **stability**.| Local elections every few years versus rare constitutional amendments shaping governance.     |
| **Polycentric Governance** | Decision-making spread across **multiple, overlapping centers** to improve adaptability.           | Regional water boards working together to manage shared watersheds.                           |
| **Actor-Network Theory** | A framework emphasizing **relationships between humans, technologies, and environments**.          | Smart city infrastructure integrating sensors, software, and public input for decision-making.|
| **Bounded Rationality**  | Decision-making limited by **information, time, and cognitive constraints**.                       | Choosing the most convenient but not optimal route to work due to limited knowledge of traffic.|
| **Relational Governance**| Governance models emphasizing **reciprocity**, **ethics**, and **distributed agency**.            | Indigenous practices of land stewardship based on respect and mutual benefit.                 |
